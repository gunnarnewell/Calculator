# Calculator
A basic starter program, written to gain experience. By Gunnar J. Newell
## Purpose

This is a simple program for me to aquaint/re-aquaint myself with some of the aspects of coding/developing. Particularly the areas concerned with building out an exe.

The goal is just to build a simple calculator with gui and all, similar to what you would see in the start up. 
## Other Notes

Built in R studio though it is written in python. 

Note that when freezing the image is moved over with an option in setup.py
# Setup
The exe is put together by cx freeze

Run: python setup.py
